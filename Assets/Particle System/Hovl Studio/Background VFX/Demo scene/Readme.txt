Upgrade project shaders if you want to use background effects with URP or HDRP.

To upgrade built-in shaders:
Open your Project in Unity, and go to Edit > Render Pipeline.
According to your needs, select either Upgrade Project Materials to Lightweight RP Materials or Upgrade Scene Materials to Lightweight RP Materials.
